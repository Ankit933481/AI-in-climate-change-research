## Objective

This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to combat the effects of climate change by improving the **accuracy, reliability, and adaptability** of environmental data analysis and forecasting.  
It highlights how AI algorithms can fill data gaps, predict trends, and support renewable energy and climate resilience initiatives.

## Problem Statement

Traditional climate models often fail due to:
- Missing or incomplete environmental data  
- Inaccurate predictions for regional climate trends  
- Limited adaptability to new, real-time information  

To address this, our research integrates **AI-based data imputation** and **Random Forest Regression** to build a model that:
- Fills missing datasets using intelligent estimation  
- Predicts next-day temperature based on multiple environmental factors  
- Improves overall forecasting accuracy

## AI Implementation

The **AI_Climate_Prediction** folder contains a Python script (`main.py`) that demonstrates how machine learning algorithms can enhance climate data reliability.

### Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- scikit-learn  

### Steps to Run
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
python main.py
